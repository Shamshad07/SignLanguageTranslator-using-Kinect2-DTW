# SignLanguageTranslatorusing Kinect2
SignLangaugeTranslator using DTW

This application translates Sign Language gestures into text.

Sign Language gestures are complex in nature, and this program is used to find the accuracy of Sign Language gestures using DTW algorithm. This application is built using Discrete Gesture Basics of KinectSDK2.0 and referring KinectSDK Dynamic time warping(DTW) Gesture Recognition.

To perform gestures using this application, At first one should stand in standstill position to start and end the gestures. The gestures which are recognised are based on the least cost from the DTW cost matrix. This approach works well for small gesture dataset. However, it is unrealisitic for the large dataset.

The dataset which is used in this application is provided by the Sign Language teacher of Bavaria. 11 DGS gestures are used for the application
